# SQL Project

Developed scripts to create a relalationship database for a fictitious video game store, as well as queries to retrieve the following information:
1. List all the customer’s names, dates, and products or services used/booked/rented/bought by 
these customers in a range of two dates.
2. List the best three customers/products/services/places (you are free to define the criteria for 
what means “best”)
3. Get the average amount of sales/bookings/rents/deliveries for a period that involves 2 or more 
years, as in the following example. This query only returns one record:
PeriodOfSales TotalSales (euros) YearlyAverage (of 
the given period)
MonthlyAverage (of 
the given period)
01/2010 – 10/2021 XXXXX € XXXXX € XXXX €
4. Get the total sales/bookings/rents/deliveries by geographical location (city/country).
5. List all the locations where products/services were sold, and the product has customer’s ratings
