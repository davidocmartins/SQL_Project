# SQL Project

Developed scripts to create a relalationship database for a fictitious video game store, as well as queries to retrieve the following information:
1. List all the customer’s names, dates, and products or services used/booked/rented/bought by 
these customers in a range of two dates.
2. List the best three customers/products/services/places (you are free to define the criteria for 
what means “best”)
3. Get the average amount of sales/bookings/rents/deliveries for a period that involves 2 or more 
years.
4. Get the total sales/bookings/rents/deliveries by geographical location (city/country).
5. List all the locations where products/services were sold, and the product has customer’s ratings

Bonus tasks:
- Create 2 triggers:
1. one for updates (you can choose any updating process, for example, if a product is sold, the trigger may update the available stock of products). 
2. a trigger that inserts a row in a “log” table (ERD should include a log table).
